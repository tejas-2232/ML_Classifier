# ML_Classifier
## Here we are buiding a ML classifier in python using Scikit-learn
simple machine learning algorithm in
Python using Scikit-learn, a machine learning tool for python

We'll use a database of breast cancer tumor information using Naive Bayes (NB) classifier that predicts whether or not a tumor is malignant or benign.

By the end you will know how to build your own ML model in  python
